        <h3>A little about myself...</h3>
        <p>Hello people!<br>
          It is I, Gru! <br>
          You might know me from my accomplishments, such as stealing the moon and accidentally saving the world. These
          days,
          I’ve traded in my life of evil schemes for family life, science, and the occasional explosions.
          <br>
          After adopting my three wonderful daughters (Margo, Edith, and Agnes) I discovered there’s more to life than
          world domination. Now, I channel my brilliance into slightly less evil pursuits: inventing gadgets, running
          experiments that may or may not involve shrink rays, and trying to keep the Minions from destroying my
          kitchen.

        <h3> Hobbies!</h3>

        <p>Inventing Gadgets, family time, and hanging out with my minions are my favourite activities. What else...
          probably science experiments, having nostalgia about my villain days and baking.
          My favourite baked good is banana bread with a good banana shake and banana pudding.
          Even though I’ve left my villainous ways behind I never do anything halfway.<br>
          Whether it’s saving the world or making Agnes smile, I give it my all.<br>
          Mwahahahaha!(Still terrifying. Still got it.)
